# Floating-population

To investigate the impact of commuting population flows on housing prices in Busan, we collected commuting population data by district in Busan. 
This data was then merged with our existing hedonic dataset based on date and location to create an aggregated hedonic dataset.

Data in this repository consists of Excel and CSV files:

- *Busan Commuting Population.xlsx*: Aggregated hedonic dataset of 52,644 observations with 27 variables
- *Hedonic data.csv*: Aggregated hedonic dataset of 52,644 observations with 27 variables

# Floating-population

To investigate the impact of commuting population flows on housing prices in Busan, we collected commuting population data by district in Busan. 
This data was then merged with our existing hedonic dataset based on date and location to create an aggregated hedonic dataset.

Data in this repository consists of Excel and CSV files:

- *Property Price and Green Index.xlsx*: Aggregated hedonic dataset of 52,644 observations with 27 variables
- *Calculated Greenness.csv*: Converted value data of GSV images in the *GSV IMAGE* folder
